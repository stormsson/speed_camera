# Example Configuration File for Car Speed Detection
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust values for your video

# Left measurement coordinate (X pixel position)
# This is where the car's speed measurement starts
left_coordinate: 100

# Right measurement coordinate (X pixel position)
# This is where the car's speed measurement ends
# MUST be greater than left_coordinate
right_coordinate: 500

# Real-world distance between left and right coordinates
# Measured in centimeters
# Example: 200 cm = 2 meters
distance: 200

# Video frame rate (frames per second)
# Should match your video's actual FPS
# Common values: 24, 25, 30, 60
fps: 30
