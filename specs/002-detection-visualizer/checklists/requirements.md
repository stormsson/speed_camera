# Specification Quality Checklist: Car Detection Process Visualizer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items pass. Specification is ready for planning phase.
- Note: User requested PySide6 as implementation technology, which is documented in assumptions but not specified in requirements to maintain technology-agnostic approach.
- Updated 2025-01-27: Added User Story 4 (Debug Detection Events) and functional requirements FR-020 through FR-026 to support debugging unexpected detection events. All new requirements are testable, technology-agnostic, and have clear acceptance criteria. New success criteria SC-007 and SC-008 added for debugging capabilities.
